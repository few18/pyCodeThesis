# pyCodeThesis

This repository contains the data and code used for the Master Thesis "Causality Detection in Nonlinear Comlex Ecosystems"
by Filip Weidler.
All the code for generating phase lock twin surrogates was written or adapted by Shivan Parmar for his thesis.
I slightly modified the code for the Deep ESN from the code of Luca Pedrelli: https://github.com/lucapedrelli/DeepESN
The IAAFT surrogate methods is from: https://github.com/mlcs/iaaft
